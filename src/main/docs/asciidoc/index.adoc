= Getting Started With Spring REST Docs

This is an example output for a service running at https://example-billing-api.herokuapp.com:

include::{generated}/overview.adoc[]
== Authentication and authorization
Though outside the scope of this assignment, this REST API would ideally use the OAuth 2.0 protocol to authorize calls.
include::{generated}/paths.adoc[]
include::{generated}/security.adoc[]
include::{generated}/definitions.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
